Once they log in, they are able to search for books, leave reviews for individual books, and see the reviews made by other people. Also it's possible to use the a third-party API by Goodreads, another book review website, to pull in ratings from a broader audience. Finally, users are able to query for book details and book reviews programmatically via the websiteâ€™s API.
